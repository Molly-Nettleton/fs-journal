# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  A: Definitely got a better understanding of HTML structure. Discovered my love of CSS styling! Probably my favorite part. Had a lot of fun building my webpages.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  A: How little code you actually need to make a really snazzy web page!

- What are you struggling with?
  A: Bootstrap. It both cleared things up, and also complicated things a bit. Definitely good for understanding the utility of boxes, but I'm struggling a little bit when it comes to which boxes need what labels, and so on.

- What would you count as a victory?
  A: The coding language barrier was very intimidating but I really feel like I have a stronger grasp of the terminology now. I had a lot of fun this week.
