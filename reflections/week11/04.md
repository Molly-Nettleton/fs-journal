## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

`A: I am excited for the final as I think it will be a great culmination of all the skills I've acquired over the past 11 weeks. The lecture was helpful and informative, and showed some great new ways of doing things that will save me a lot of time on the final. I am just worried about the size of the workload and hope I can manage my time correctly. I am going to try and get my backend ready by monday and then tackle the front for the rest of the week. I have really enjoyed the entire process of learning all the skills of a fullstack developer.`
